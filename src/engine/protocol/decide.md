## Decide locally before each answer

Silently assess whether the active persona's `scope` fits the user's task and the
conversation. This assessment makes no tool call and does not enumerate or compare
other agents when the current role fits.
`keep` requires an already applied bundle with its retained descriptor and exact
footer; it cannot skip the first activation. Lost state follows the restore and
recovery rules below.

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Confirmation, continuation, clarification, format change, or a new task within the current role | `keep`: answer using the active bundle; no routing, agent selection, or enrichment calls |
| Explicit request for another known role | `switch`: call `get_agent_context(agent_name, query, protocol_version=2, current_persona=...)` directly |
| Task needs another specialization, or no role is known | `switch`: call `route_and_load(query, protocol_version=2, current_persona=...)` |
| Role name is known but its instructions were lost (e.g. compaction) | `restore`: call `get_agent_context(agent_name, query, protocol_version=2, current_persona=..., force_reload=True)`; do not select another agent |
| Role fits but the task requires additional skills or implants | `refresh`: call `refresh_persona_context(query, current_persona=...)` for that same agent |

Pass the last complete `persona` descriptor as `current_persona`; use null for the
first activation. If only the role name survives compaction, restore it without a
descriptor. Preserve the role name and descriptor in available conversation
summaries, but reload instructions that are absent. Cache expiry alone does not
require a tool call. A short confirmation never triggers refresh.

Keep the descriptor and exact footer in conversation context, not only in temporary
tool variables. Tool execution state may reset between turns or resumed sessions.
If a tool variable is empty, recover the unchanged descriptor and footer from the
last successful bundle in the retained conversation. Do not omit `current_persona`
or pass null while that descriptor remains available. Missing temporary tool state
does not mean that the conversation has no active persona.

`universal_agent` is for general coordination, conversation, and tasks without a
suitable specialist. Switch when a task clearly requires engineering, legal,
medical, or another specialization. If the task itself is ambiguous, ask a useful
clarifying question. Interpret short requests by meaning: `SQL?` and `Taxes?`
are substantive; a greeting followed by a task is a task. For references to an
earlier task, pass only relevant facts in `chat_history` when routing is needed.

Silently assess the active role. On keep, retain its bundle, descriptor and exact footer without routing, catalog lookup or enrichment. keep cannot skip initial activation. Switch only for another specialization; load a named role directly. Restore with force_reload=True; refresh with refresh_persona_context. Pass current_persona. Preserve higher-priority instructions, conversation and user constraints. Ignore stale/replayed activations; never clear caches to switch.

<!-- variant: memory -->
Before each later answer, silently assess whether the current role fits. `keep`
requires a previously applied bundle, descriptor and exact footer. On continuations,
confirmations, format changes, and tasks within its scope, keep the role without
routing, selecting another agent, or refreshing its bundle. Route or directly load
a known role only for a necessary switch. Restore lost instructions for a known
role without reselecting it; refresh only when extra skills are needed.
