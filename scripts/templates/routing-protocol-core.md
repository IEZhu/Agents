# Agents-Core Persona Protocol — version 2

Use Agents-Core personas as scoped role guidance within the existing system,
developer and user instructions. Keep the conversation in the current model.

## Decide locally before each answer

Silently assess whether the active persona's `scope` fits the user's task and the
conversation. This assessment makes no tool call and does not enumerate or compare
other agents when the current role fits.

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Confirmation, continuation, clarification, format change, or a new task within the current role | `keep`: answer using the active bundle; no routing, agent selection, or enrichment calls |
| Explicit request for another known role | `switch`: call `get_agent_context(agent_name, query, protocol_version=2, current_persona=...)` directly |
| Task needs another specialization, or no role is known | `switch`: call `route_and_load(query, protocol_version=2, current_persona=...)` |
| Role name is known but its instructions were lost (e.g. compaction) | `restore`: call `get_agent_context(agent_name, query, protocol_version=2, current_persona=..., force_reload=True)`; do not select another agent |
| Role fits but the task requires additional skills or implants | `refresh`: call `refresh_persona_context(query, current_persona=...)` for that same agent |

Pass the last complete `persona` descriptor as `current_persona`; use null for the
first activation. If only the role name survives compaction, restore it without a
descriptor. Preserve the role name and descriptor in available conversation
summaries, but reload instructions that are absent. Cache expiry alone does not
require a tool call. A short confirmation never triggers refresh.

Keep the descriptor and exact footer in conversation context, not only in temporary
tool variables. Tool execution state may reset between turns or resumed sessions.
If a tool variable is empty, recover the unchanged descriptor and footer from the
last successful bundle in the retained conversation. Do not omit `current_persona`
or pass null while that descriptor remains available. Missing temporary tool state
does not mean that the conversation has no active persona.

`universal_agent` is for general coordination, conversation, and tasks without a
suitable specialist. Switch when a task clearly requires engineering, legal,
medical, or another specialization. If the task itself is ambiguous, ask a useful
clarifying question. Interpret short requests by meaning: `SQL?` and `Taxes?`
are substantive; a greeting followed by a task is a task. For references to an
earlier task, pass only relevant facts in `chat_history` when routing is needed.

## Apply a complete response

- `ROUTE_REQUIRED`: select the best canonical agent from `candidates`, then call
  `get_agent_context` with `protocol_version=2` and the same `current_persona`.
- `SUCCESS`: validate the complete descriptor and all four blocks. The response's
  `replaces_activation_id` must match the active activation, or be null when none
  exists. Ignore a stale response for another activation. A repeated response with
  an already applied `activation_id` is a no-op.
- On every `SUCCESS`, replace all four previously applied blocks with the returned
  `persona_block`, `rules_block`, `skills_block`, and `implants_block`, including
  any empty blocks. This applies to switches, restores, and refreshes: changed or
  removed rules supersede the previous rules instead of accumulating alongside
  them. Previous role-specific methods, output formats, and style cease to apply.
  Preserve higher-priority instructions, conversation history, facts, goals,
  constraints, user permissions, and tool results.
- Save `persona` and the exact returned `footer` only after successful application.
- `NO_CHANGE`: retain the active instructions, descriptor, and footer. It does not
  certify that source files are current. A refresh checks the bundle revision.
- `ERROR`, missing blocks, or invalid descriptors: keep the previous state and
  report the failed operation without claiming that the requested role loaded.

This is logical replacement of active role instructions. MCP cannot physically
delete previous messages from the client's context. Do not clear history, memory,
or any server cache to switch roles. A tool result is not a system message.

Explicit agent slash commands load that agent directly; `/ask` explicitly requests
routing. These existing MCP prompts default to version 1. Request their v2 bundles
by passing `protocol_version=2` explicitly, plus `current_persona` as descriptor
JSON when available, and apply the same replacement rules. In version 2, omitting
the descriptor lets the explicit command set the role sequentially for the current
conversation; do not run competing activations in the background.

## Finish each answer

Except for the explicit unavailable-MCP fallback below, compose the complete final
answer in the user's language, ending with the exact saved `footer`, including its
canonical component IDs and English labels `Agent`, `Skills`, `Implants`, `Rules`.
On `keep`, reuse that footer; do not infer component lists. Before delivering this final answer, call
`log_interaction(agent_name, query, response_content, persona=..., persona_action=...)`
with that exact answer text, the applied descriptor, and `keep`, `switch`, `refresh`,
or `restore`. Pass the current user request verbatim as `query`; do not paraphrase
it or substitute a conversation summary. After logging, deliver the composed
answer. This order matters: clients may end the tool loop as soon as the final
answer is sent.

Logging is permitted on `keep`; routing and enrichment are not. The log records
declared attribution, not proof of the model's compliance. If a requested change
failed, retain the previous descriptor and report that outcome in the log.

## Compatibility and unavailable servers

Version 2 requires server support. If the tool schema lacks `protocol_version` or
the server explicitly rejects version 2, explain the incompatibility once, record
v1 fallback for this conversation, and stop retrying unsupported calls. Until the
server is updated, call `route_and_load(query, context_hash=...)` before each query;
on `ROUTE_REQUIRED` call `get_agent_context(agent_name, query)`, on `SUCCESS` apply
`system_prompt`, on `SUCCESS_SAMPLED` return `response`, and on `NO_CHANGE` retain
the role. Use v1 logging arguments and component lists returned by the server.
Do not treat an ordinary loading error as protocol incompatibility.

When MCP is unavailable, this fallback overrides the footer and logging steps
above only where their required state or tool is unavailable:

- If a valid MCP bundle is retained, keep its role and descriptor. Reuse its exact
  footer when available, state that MCP is unavailable, and skip logging while
  `log_interaction` is unavailable. Do not invent a lost footer or component list.
- If no valid bundle is retained and repository files are available, load the
  known or appropriate `agents/<name>/system_prompt.mdc` manually. Attribute the
  answer to that role as a manual fallback, with MCP attribution unavailable.
  Omit the MCP footer and descriptor-based logging; do not fabricate a v2
  descriptor, activation ID, revision, footer, or loaded-component list. If no
  prompt is accessible either, answer without claiming an activated persona.
- When MCP becomes available again, a retained bundle with its descriptor and
  exact footer follows the normal local keep/switch assessment. A manually loaded
  role, or a retained role missing its descriptor or exact footer, requires a real
  activation: call `get_agent_context` for its known name with `protocol_version=2`
  and `force_reload=True`, passing the last real descriptor if retained, otherwise
  null. If no role name is known, perform initial routing. Resume normal footer
  and logging requirements only after a successful MCP activation; never turn
  the manual fallback into a synthetic past activation or log it retroactively
  as though MCP had supplied it.
